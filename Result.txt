And not to venture from his sight!
With someone who is halfway dead,
To prop up pillows by his head,
When in good earnest he fell ill,
To bring him medicine, looking tearful,
Let others profit by his lesson,
My uncle is a man of honour,
And found the role he best could fill.
To sigh â€” while inwardly you think:
When will the devil let him sink?
What shameful cunning to be cheerful
But, oh my God, what desolation
He won respect by his demeanour
To tend a sick man day and night
